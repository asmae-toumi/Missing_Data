# CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES OF MISSING DATA

- `Causes`: 
  - Participant skipped the question
  - Participant refuses to cooperate
  - Data/coding error 
  - Drop outs from longitudinal research 
  - Question not asked
  - Censoring

- `Consequences`:
  - Less data than planned
  - Insufficient statistical power
  - Inconsistent sample sizes across analyses
  - Difficulty calculating even the most simple summary statistics
  - Difficulty determining appropriate confidence interval, p-values  
  - Systematic biases in the analysis 

**In sum, missing data can render analysis and interpretation difficult or impossible when unaddressed**

# IMPUTING MISSING DATA

# MISSING DATA ASSUMPTIONS

According to Rubin (1976), there are 3 types of missing data assumptions:

- `MCAR`: Missing Completely at Random

Missing data is at random and the *pattern* of missing values is not related to the structure of the data. 

- `MAR`: Missing at Random

Missing data is not completely random and the probability of missingness relies on the observed data, not the missing data. 

- `MNAR`: Missing Not at Random

The missing data is not random and it's associated with factors that are unobservable and unknown to the analyst.

---

# OPTIONS YOU CAN TAKE 

- `List-wise deletion` 

  - Also called Complete Case Analysis (CCA)
  - Lose statistical power 
  - Large standard errors

- `Mean/median substitution`

  - Disturbs the distribution
  - Underestimates the variance 

---

# A BETTER OPTION

- `Multiple Imputation`

  - Accounts for the uncertainty around the "true" value
  - Obtains approximately unbiased estimates
  - Flexible to data type and analysis

The assumption is that **missing values can be imputed using predictions derived by the observable portion of the dataset**. 

If this assumption is not met, missing data cannot be imputed using multiple imputation.

# APPROACHES TO MULTIPLE IMPUTATION

- `Joint Multivariate Normal Distribution Multiple Imputation`: 
  - Assumption: observed data follows a multivariate normal distribution
  - Disadvantage: if the data doesn't follow a the above distribution, the imputed values will be incorrect
  - 2 packages do this: `Amelia` and `norm`

- `Conditional Multiple Imputation`: 
  - Follows an iterative procedure, modeling the conditional distribution of a certain variable given the other variables 
  - Advantage: flexible because a distribution is assumed for **each** variable as opposed to the whole dataset 
    - `mice` does this (van Buuren, 2011)

# MICE

`mice` package computes missing data in 3 steps: mids (*multiply imputed data*), mira (*multiply imputed repeated analysis*) and mipo (*multiply imputed pooled object*)

# STEPS IN MICE 

`mice()` command assumes the specific distribution of the missing variable and draws from that distribution in order to replace missing values with possible values. Multiple complete datasets get generated, called **mids** which stands for **multiply imputed dataset**

`with()` command runs regressions for each complete dataset, generating `n` sets of coefficients. These analysis results are stored in an object of class **mira** which stands for **multiply imputed repeated analysis**

`pool()` command takes the mean of the `n` regression coefficients and estimates the variance (within and between the complete datasets)

# PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF MICE

See `Practice.Rmd`

---

# Roadblocks  

- Violation of assumptions

- Too much missing data

- Wrong method in imputation

- High multicollinearity


`In conclusion, missing data imputation is a powerful method but it can be  hard to implement correctly.`
